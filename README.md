Quantum GANs experimental repository.

The network architecture is based on paper by Pierre-Luc et al. [Quantum generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08641)

Current goal is to be able to generate topological phase transitions state as described in [Crossing a topological phase transition with a quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05351) by Adam Smith et al.

To play with the code use *QuGAN_PhaseTransition* notebook. 

Project under heavy development and strongly experimental.
