Quantum GANs experimental repository.

Current goal is to be able to generate topological phase transitions state as described in [Crossing a topological phase transition with a quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05351) by Adam Smith et al.

Project under heavy development and strongly experimental.
